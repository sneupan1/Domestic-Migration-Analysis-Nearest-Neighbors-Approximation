# K-Nearest Neighbors Approximation

Python program that analyzes the Domestic Migration patterns from a data-set that describes the domestic migration of a sampling of counties scattered accross the continental US. The program constructs a full map that models the missing data based on the available data using Mean K-Nearest Neighbors Approximation method.

The generated map represents the rate of domestic migration across the country.
